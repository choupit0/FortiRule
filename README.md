# FortiRule
FortiRule is a NodeJS App to update TXT files used by FortiGate Threat feeds connector. Dynamically import an external block list from an HTTP server.

But also to authorize a website, domain, or IP address within a minute across all of your sites.

This App was largely made with the help of ChatGPT from OpenAI, based on GPT-3.5 model. Of course, there was a code review afterward and security hardening was performed.
